## Description

**Monster Chase** is a 2D Unity game where a character runs or jumps to avoid enemies. This is the complete Monster Chase Game built by following the freeCodeCamp x Awesome Tuts [Unity Beginner Game Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo) on YouTube.

I used this tutorial to learn game development to help do my senior capstone project [Beat up Cancer](https://wanguijohn.itch.io/beatupcancer)
